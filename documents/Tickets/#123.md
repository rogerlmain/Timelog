Add a new field to the Projects page: Estimate.

This field has two functions:

1. It is an aggregate of all of the estimates of its subtasks (always, regardless of the second purpose), thus is dependent on the development of #122.

2. If a value is entered, then:

    - If there are no values entered as estimates for the child tasks, then this value is distributed equally amongst the children

    - If there are values entered as estimates for the child tasks, then the value is distributed weighted by existing values

        Examples using:
        
            Task A: 10 hours
            Task B: 6 hours
            Task C: 8 hours
        
        Total: 24 hours
        
        ---------------------------
        
        Example 1 - Higher value:
        
        New value: 36 hours
        
        New distribution:
        
            Task A: 15 hours
            Task B: 9 hours
            Task C: 12 hours
        
        ---------------------------
        
        Example 2 - Lower value
        
        New value: 12 hours
        
        New distribution:
        
            Task A: 5 hours
            Task B: 3 hours
            Task C: 4 hours

        ---------------------------
        
        Example 3 - Bottom out (1 is the minimum distribution allowed)

        If ratio integrity is lost due to rounding, show a message saying that estimates have bottomed out and cannot be set lower, and that the user needs to set task estimates, individually.
